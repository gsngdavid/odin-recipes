    <p>
        This salad couldn’t be simpler, and can be easily assembled almost entirely using ingredients you can find at your local farmers’ market. I bought everything except the pistachios, goat cheese, olive oil, and vinegar at mine—though you might be lucky enough to find everything at yours!
    </p>
    <p>
        As with almost anything else that showcases local and seasonal vegetables, you don’t have to do a whole lot to make things taste delicious. The less, the better.
